This can b e a painful time during which you feel hurt by someone else's actions or by an external event. You may feel that you are being forced out of your comfort zone and required to grow in ways that you would rather not. It is also possible that this current pai n has triggered memories of childhood hurts, which you had hoped to bury. While this is difficult and can leave you feeling quite powerless at times, you would do well to face the situation and move through it with strength and courage. Of course you can always ask for help from compassionate friends or professionals. Your challenge is to heal wounds from the past which may be subconsciously inhibiting the full expression of your talents now. Believe it or not by the end of the transit you may even be than kful that you have been presented with the opportunity to discover new treasures.
